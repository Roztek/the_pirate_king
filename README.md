### Game Overview

Ahoy, matey! Welcome to The Pirate King, a survival rogue-like set on a forsaken island where danger lurks at every turn. After a fierce storm, yer ship has been dashed against the rocks, leavin' ye stranded on a cursed shore. With only yer wits and sword, ye must fight to survive the island's threats. The game’s dynamic systems keep ye on yer toes, as every choice ye make can tip the scales between life and death. But beware, one wrong move and ye’ll be sent to Davy Jones’ locker, with no guarantee of findin' yer way back.

The melodies ye hear throughout yer adventure be of my own creation, crafted to keep yer heart racing as ye fight to survive. This journey also served as a mighty catalyst for me to dive deep into the seas of Godot and C#, learnin’ all the ways to make this game come alive. So, sharpen yer blade, steady yer course, and prepare for the fight of yer life!
